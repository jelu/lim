LIM - Gluing your DNS/DNSSEC stuff together since 2012

ABOUT

Lim is a management application you can put on top of DNS and DNSSEC software
so you can manage it via a web GUI or via your OSS/BSS system with SOAP.

ARCHITECTURE

    User(s):                          Master:
    +---------------+                 +------------+
    |  Web browser  |    rpc api      |            |
    |---------------| --------------> |   Master   |
    |  Lim Web GUI  |                 |            |
    +---------------+                 +------------+
                         rpc api             |
           +----------------+----------------+
 Node(s):  |                |                |
    +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
    |    Agent    |  |    Agent    |  |    Agent    |
    |-------------|  |-------------|  |-------------|
    |  Executer   |  |  Executer   |  |  Executer   |
    +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+

	- All communications over HTTPS
	- Master is chrooted, running not as root
	- Agent is chrooted, running not as root
	- Executer is not chrooted, running as root
		- AppArmor/SELinux profiles on supported platforms

AUTHENTICATION

	USER/CLIENT<->MASTER

	- TBD

	MASTER<->AGENT<->EXECUTER

	- SSL certification based, clients/servers verifies each other
	  certification
	- API key for write operations using challenge <-> response (SHA256+)
		1. Master sends write operation to Agent
		2. Agent sends write operation to Executer
		3. Executer returns ID of write operation and challenge
		4. Agent sends ID + challenge to Master
		5. Master sends ID + response to Agent
		6. Agent sends ID + response to Executer
		7. Executer does write operation if response is valid
	- API key only available for Master and Executer, Agent does not have
	  access to that information
