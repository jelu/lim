LIM - Gluing your DNS/DNSSEC stuff together since 2012

ABOUT

Lim is actually just a framework to generalize RPC calls from RESTful JSON/XML,
XML-RPC, JSON-RPC and SOAP to plugins. It was developed for managing OpenDNSSEC
and SoftHSM which is used for DNSSEC.

For more information about OpenDNSSEC and the OpenDNSSEC Lim plugin please see:

    Lim plugin - https://github.com/jelu/lim-plugin-opendnssec

For more information about SoftHSM and the SoftHSM Lim plugin please see:

ARCHITECTURE

    There are three parts (so far) in Lim; Server, Client and CLI. You can
    install them separately to be able to manage software remotely by CLI or
    by writing your own software with the Client libraries or calling the
    different RPC protocols.
    
    The Server software that is run on the machines that you want to manage is
    called an Agent daemon (lim-agentd). It will load all available plugins on
    the system and serve them through the RPC protocols.
